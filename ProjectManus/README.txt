The project currently relies on OSC in order to interact with the Manus Gloves.
OSC Server creation is done in blueprint. The server IP address may need to be changed in order for this 
interaction to work.

Pose detection relies on the Wekinator. An open source software that allows a user to send OSC data to be
processed by a machine learning algorithm. 

The Wekinator file needed to run this project can be found under the 'Wekinator' folder
